## **Representation**


The medical imaging extension proposal represents imaging characteristics through two new tables—Image_occurrence and Image_features.

## **Schema**

### Image_occurrence  

<br>
Table Description  

The Image_occurrence table describes imaging events and provides data lineage to the imaging study stored in DICOM format. 
<br>

<br>
User Guide  

Each row in Image_occurrence represents a collection of images acquired on an imaging modality using a contiguous imaging technique. This is referred to as a DICOM series. Each DICOM series can be an independent modality and acquisition technique grouped within a DICOM study (e.g., PET/CT scan).

cdmTableName|cdmFieldName|isRequired|cdmDatatype|userGuidance
:-------------------|:-----------------------|:--------|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------
|image_occurrence|image_occurrence_id|Yes|integer|The unique key is given to an imaging study record (often referred to as the accession number or imaging order number)|  
|image_occurrence|person_id|Yes|integer|The person_id of the Person for whom the procedure is recorded. This can be a system-generated code or adopted from original source.|
|image_occurrence|procedure_occurrence_id|Yes|integer|The unique key is given to a procedure record for a person. Link to the Procedure_occurrence table.|
|image_occurrence|visit_occurrence_id|No|integer|The unique key is given to the visit record for a person. Link to the Visit_occurrence table.|
|image_occurrence|anatomic_site_concept_id|No|integer|Anatomical location of the imaging procedure by the medical acquisition device (gross anatomy). It maps the ANATOMIC_SITE_SOURCE_VALUE to a Standard Concept in the Spec Anatomic Site domain. This should be coded at the lowest level of granularity.|
|image_occurrence|wadors_uri|No|varchar (max)|A Web Access to DICOM Objects via Restful Web Services Uniform Resource Identifier on study level.|
|image_occurrence|local_path|Yes|varchar (max)|"Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path to the folder containing the image object file access via a storage block access protocol. (e.g., \\Server\Directory)"|
|image_occurrence|image_occurrence_date|Yes|date|The date the imaging procedure occurred.|
|image_occurrence|image_study_UID|Yes|varchar (250)|DICOM Study UID|
|image_occurrence|image_series_UID|Yes|varchar (250)|DICOM Series UID|
|image_occurrence|modality|Yes|varchar (250)|"DICOM-defined value (e.g., US, CT, MR, PT, DR, CR, NM)"|




<br>




### Image_feature
<br>
Table Description  

Imaging features are comprised of segmentation algorithm results executed on the images, image acquisition parameters, and structured radiology reports. The Image_feature table describes the characteristics of the images and their provenance.

<br>

User Guide  

Each row will contain a uniquely identified feature with links to the source imaging as well as the clinical domain table the feature is located in. The image_feature_type_concept_id will describe the method used to create that feature (e.g., machine learning algorithm, DICOM structured report). Image acquisition parameters will also be stored in the clinical domain tables and linked to the source images through the image feature table. This allows the cardinality to include multiple acquisition parameters as well as the benefit of being able to query them with existing tooling in the OHDSI platform.
